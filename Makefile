# tag; on the server, infra/terraform's container_image variable points at the
# new tag and `terraform apply` (Vultr) or a manual `docker compose pull &&
# docker compose up -d` (either environment) picks it up.
#
# GHCR defaults a newly pushed package to private. After the first publish,
# set it public in the package's GitHub settings (and "connect repository")
# or every deploy needs a PAT with read:packages — the same trap
# website-backend's README documents for its (deliberately private) image.
