// Package payment is the gateway-agnostic half of taking money: the interface a
// gateway implements, the values it exchanges with the rest of the store, and a
// fake for tests.
//
// Two real gateways ship, in internal/payment/payfast and
// internal/payment/snapscan, and a store may enable either or both. The split
// exists so that adding a third is a documented extension point rather than a
// fork, and so the handler tests never talk to a payment provider — see fake.go
// and CONTRIBUTING.md.
//
// # What the second gateway changed
//
// This interface was PayFast-shaped until SnapScan arrived, and the differences
// are worth stating because they are the differences between gateways generally,
// not a quirk of one:
//
//   - **A hand-over is not always a form post.** PayFast wants a cross-origin
//     POST of signed fields; SnapScan wants the shopper to open a single URL,
//     which on a phone opens its app and on a desktop is a QR code to scan. Hence
//     Handover, with a Kind, rather than a form and nothing else.
//   - **A notification is not always authenticated from its body.** PayFast signs
//     the body and notifies from published IP ranges; SnapScan puts an HMAC in an
//     Authorization header. Hence Notification, which carries the request's parts
//     rather than just its bytes.
//   - **Status vocabularies differ, and neither belongs in the handler.** PayFast
//     says COMPLETE and CANCELLED, SnapScan says completed and error. Each
//     gateway maps its own words onto Outcome, and the handler only ever reads
//     Outcome.
