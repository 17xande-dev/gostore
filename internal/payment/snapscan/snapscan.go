// Package snapscan implements payment.Gateway for SnapScan, the South African
// QR payment app.
//
// It is the second gateway in this store, and the one that made the payment
// interface honest: SnapScan is not a redirect gateway. There is no page to post
// signed fields to. A payment is a URL carrying an order reference and an amount,
// which the shopper opens — on a phone that URL opens the SnapScan app, and on a
// desktop it is a QR code to scan with one. The store then hears about the
// outcome twice over: once from a webhook, and once from an authenticated read of
// SnapScan's own API, which is the only half it actually trusts.
//
// The spec is at https://developer.snapscan.co.za.
//
// # Three things worth knowing before changing this
//
//   - **There is no sandbox.** Any configuration here is live money. That is the
//     opposite of PayFast, whose sandbox is the default, and it is why nothing in
//     this package has a "test mode" knob that could be left on.
//   - **strict=true and the signature do different jobs.** The Secure QR
//     signature fixes the amount; strict additionally refuses a second successful
//     payment against the same id. A store wants both, so both are sent whenever
//     a validation key is configured.
//   - **The webhook proves very little on its own.** SnapScan's own documentation
//     calls it "an unauthenticated event stream" and points at the API for
//     certainty. The HMAC is necessary and not sufficient: see webhook.go.
