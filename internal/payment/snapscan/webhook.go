// Two independent things have to be true before this returns without an error,

//
//  1. **The body is signed with the webhook key.** That proves the request came
//     from someone holding the shared secret — but SnapScan's own documentation
//     calls the webhook an unauthenticated event stream, and a shared secret is
//     only as good as everywhere it has ever been copied.
//  2. **SnapScan's API says the same thing.** The payment is read back over an
//     authenticated connection, and the status and amount this store acts on come
//     from *that* response, never from the notification body. A forged body that
//     somehow cleared the first check still cannot invent a completed payment.
//
// This is the same shape as the PayFast implementation's server-to-server
// confirmation, for the same reason, and it is the whole argument for the
// network call: without it, one leaked key is a free order.
