// How the store answers when something has gone wrong.
//
// Three pages, because they say three different things. `not_found` is the common
// one and has its own copy and a search box. `error_client` covers the rest of the
// 4xx range — you asked for something that is not yours, or came too fast — and
// `error_server` covers 5xx, where the honest message is that this is ours and not
// yours.
//
// Two rules hold everywhere in this file:
//
//   - **Every one falls back to plain text.** These are the responses an adopter's
//     broken theme override is most likely to break, and a 500 that fails to render
//     must still be a 500. h.render would log and leave the status at 200, which is
//     the one outcome a crawler must never see.
//   - **A full page never lands in a fragment.** htmx is configured to swap error
//     responses (see the htmx-config meta tag in layout.html), so an error page sent
//     to an htmx request must say "replace the document" or it would be pasted into
//     whatever small target the request was aimed at.
//
// Byte endpoints use none of it: a missing image or asset answers with the plain
// text, because nothing is going to read an HTML page in an <img> tag and sending
// one would only make the failure larger.

// errorPageData is what both error templates render. Detail is populated only in
// development; see config.ShowErrorDetail.
type errorPageData struct {

	Status  int

	// Reference is the request id, so that "I got an error, it said 7f3a9c2e" is
