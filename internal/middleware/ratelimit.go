// Per-IP rate limiting.
//
// The split here is deliberate: the token bucket comes from x/time/rate, because
// that is the part with the clock edge cases and the off-by-ones already found in
// it, while the keyed map, the eviction and the choice of key stay in this file
// where they can be read. A bucket is simple arithmetic; a bucket per client, with
// bounded memory, is where the actual decisions are.
//
// # What this protects, and how it answers
//
// Three surfaces, with different limits and — importantly — different meanings for
// a refusal:
//
//   - **Admin login.** Brute force. The argon2id verification already costs real
//     time, but cost is not a limit.
//   - **Checkout.** Order-row spam. Refusing is a nuisance to a real shopper, so
//     the limit is loose enough that nobody hits it by clicking twice.
//   - **The payment callback.** Unauthenticated, and every request makes the store
//     POST to the gateway to validate it — an amplifier. This one is the reason a
//     limit exists at all.
//
// The callback deserves its own note. The webhook handler answers 200 to
// everything, deliberately, so a gateway does not retry a notification that was
// forged. A *throttled* request is the opposite case: it has not been looked at,
// and it must be retried. So the limiter answers 429 with Retry-After, and because
// it sits in front of the handler, the gateway retries as it should. "Always 200"
// applies to notifications the store has actually read.

// RateLimitConfig is one limiter's settings.

	// Name appears in the log line for a refusal, so a rejection can be traced to

	// second.
	Every time.Duration
