# gostore

A small, self-hostable online store written in Go: `html/template` fragments for an
htmx frontend, PostgreSQL for storage, and [PayFast](https://payfast.io) for payments.
Stdlib-first, with a deliberately tiny dependency surface.

> **Status: early.** The skeleton (config, migrations, container stack, health check)
> works. Catalog, cart, checkout and the PayFast integration are being built in that
> order — see the build order below.

## Why

Go has no maintained open-source store, and no PayFast integration at all. This aims to
be honest and good at one thing: a small catalog of physical goods — books and apparel —
sold in ZAR, with variants, stock, and a spare admin UI. It is not a general commerce
platform.

## Quickstart

```sh
git clone https://github.com/17xande-dev/gostore
cd gostore
make up
curl localhost:8080/healthz   # -> ok
```

`make up` starts Postgres, [mailpit](http://localhost:8025) (captures outgoing email),
[MinIO](http://localhost:9001) (S3-compatible object storage) and the server. Migrations
are applied automatically on boot.

Other useful targets:

| Target | Does |
|---|---|
| `make down` | Stop the stack (`make down ARGS=-v` also deletes the data volumes) |
| `make run` | Run the server on the host against the compose Postgres |
| `make test` | Run every test, including the database-backed ones |
| `make psql` | Open a `psql` shell on the compose database |
| `make logs` | Follow the server logs |
| `make migrate` | Apply pending migrations without starting the server |
| `make migrate-status` | Show which migrations have been applied |

## Configuration

Everything comes from the environment; see [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full
list with defaults.

| Var | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | **yes** | — | Postgres connection string |
| `PORT` | no | `8080` | Listen port |
| `BASE_URL` | no | `http://localhost:8080` | Public origin, for absolute URLs |
| `STORE_NAME` | no | `gostore` | Displayed store name |
| `CURRENCY` | no | `ZAR` | Currency code (PayFast requires `ZAR`) |
| `TEMPLATE_DIR` | no | — | Directory of templates that override the embedded defaults |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn` or `error` |
| `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | no | `15` | Grace period for in-flight requests |

PayFast, admin and object-storage settings arrive with their phases.

## Deploying

The binary is static and the image is distroless, so it runs anywhere a container does.
Four things are all that separate "runs on a managed platform" from "runs on a VM behind
a reverse proxy", and the server does all four: it reads `PORT` from the environment,
takes a single `DATABASE_URL`, logs JSON to stdout, and serves `GET /healthz`.

Migrations run on boot, before the server accepts traffic, guarded by a Postgres advisory
lock so several instances starting at once cannot race. Where you would rather migrate as
its own deploy step, run the same image with `-migrate` first and start the server after
it exits; `-migrate-status` prints what has been applied.

## Development

```sh
make test          # TEST_DATABASE_URL defaults to the compose database
go test ./...      # database-backed tests skip when TEST_DATABASE_URL is unset
```

Database tests create a dedicated schema per test and drop it on cleanup, so they never
interfere with each other or with development data.

### Migrations

Numbered `.sql` files in `internal/db/migrations`, managed by
[goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose), embedded into the binary and applied in one
transaction each.

To add one, create `NNNN_name.sql` with a version above every existing file and a
`-- +goose Up` section:

```sql
-- +goose Up
ALTER TABLE products ADD COLUMN subtitle TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '';

-- +goose Down
ALTER TABLE products DROP COLUMN subtitle;
```

Three rules, each with teeth:

- **Never edit a migration that has been applied anywhere.** goose records versions, not
  checksums, so an edited file is silently skipped and the schema quietly diverges from
  the one in the repository. Add a new migration instead.
- **Number above every existing file.** Out-of-order migrations are rejected, because a
  file numbered below one already applied would produce a different schema depending on
  when you first ran it — unacceptable in a project other people run against their data.
- **Down sections are for local development.** Production is forward-only: rolling a
  schema back over live orders loses money, not just columns.

Statements that cannot run inside a transaction — `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, most
notably — need `-- +goose NO TRANSACTION` at the top of the file.

The files are ordinary goose migrations, so the `goose` CLI works against this directory
unchanged when a migration needs to be inspected or applied by hand.

## Build order

1. **Skeleton** — config, migration runner, compose, Dockerfile, `/healthz`, CI ← *done*
2. Catalog — products and variants, seed command, unprotected admin CRUD
3. Admin auth
4. Storefront reads and the template override mechanism
5. Cart
6. Checkout + PayFast
7. Order emails + admin orders
8. Images (object storage)
9. Hardening
10. Publish
